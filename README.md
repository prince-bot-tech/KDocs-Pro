# KDocs-Pro

A job-document generator for the Kenyan market: CVs, cover letters, resignation
letters and more — 3 templates each, covering before/during/after a job.
Free watermarked preview; KSh 25 via M-Pesa (Daraja) to unlock the clean PDF.

**Honest note on the "anti-screenshot" request:** no website can truly stop
someone from screenshotting their own screen — that control belongs to the
phone/computer, not the browser. What this app does instead (and what
actually works) is simple: it never sends the clean, finished PDF to the
browser until your Daraja callback confirms the KSh 25 was paid. Before that,
the person only ever sees a blurred, watermarked preview. That's the real
protection. On top of that, it adds small speed bumps (right-click disabled,
Ctrl+P/S blocked, preview blurs if they switch tabs) — nice to have, not
bulletproof, and I want you to know that going in rather than oversell it.

## Explain-it-like-I'm-8 guide to going live

### Step 1: Put your project on GitHub (like a shelf everyone can see)
1. Go to github.com and make a free account if you don't have one.
2. Click the green "New" button to make a new repository. Call it `kdocs-pro`.
3. On your own computer, open a terminal inside this folder and type:
   ```
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "first version of KDocs-Pro"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/kdocs-pro.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
4. Refresh the GitHub page — your files should now be there. That's it, your
   code now lives on GitHub's shelf.

### Step 2: Get your M-Pesa keys from Daraja (the payment "key")
1. Go to https://developer.safaricom.co.ke and make a free account.
2. Click "Create App" — this gives you a **Consumer Key** and **Consumer
   Secret**. Copy them somewhere safe.
3. For testing, Safaricom gives everyone a free practice till number
   (174379) and a practice passkey — you'll find both on the "Lipa na
   M-Pesa Sandbox" page in your Daraja account.
4. When you're ready for real payments, you apply for a real Till/Paybill
   number from Safaricom and swap the sandbox numbers for your real ones.

### Step 3: Put the app "online" using Render (like turning on a light switch)
1. Go to render.com and sign up (you can sign up using your GitHub account —
   easiest option).
2. Click "New" → "Web Service".
3. Pick the `kdocs-pro` repository you pushed in Step 1.
4. Render will ask a few questions — answer like this:
   - **Build Command:** `npm install`
   - **Start Command:** `npm start`
5. Scroll to "Environment Variables" and add every line from the
   `.env.example` file in this project, filled in with your real Daraja
   details from Step 2. For `DARAJA_CALLBACK_URL`, use the web address
   Render gives your app (something like
   `https://kdocs-pro.onrender.com/api/daraja/callback`) — you may need to
   deploy once first to see that address, then paste it in and redeploy.
6. Click "Create Web Service". Render will build your app and after a
   minute or two, give you a live link like `https://kdocs-pro.onrender.com`.
7. Open that link in your browser — your app is now live for anyone in the
   world to use!

### Step 4: Test it before telling real customers
1. Open your live link.
2. Go through the flow: pick a stage → document → template → fill the form
   → preview → pay.
3. Use Safaricom's **sandbox test phone number** (found on the Daraja
   website) so you don't spend real money while testing.
4. Once it works end-to-end, swap in your real Till number and go live for
   real customers.

## Running it on your own computer first (recommended before Step 1)
```
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # then fill in your real values
npm start
```
Open http://localhost:10000 in your browser.

## Project map
- `server.js` — the main app, wires everything together
- `routes/daraja.js` — talks to M-Pesa (start payment, receive confirmation)
- `utils/pdfGenerator.js` — builds the actual PDF (preview vs. clean copy)
- `utils/templates.js` — the list of document types, stages, and 3 templates
- `public/` — everything the user sees (HTML/CSS/JS), white background,
  blue buttons, with a dark-mode toggle in the top-right corner
